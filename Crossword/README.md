# HTML5 Crossword Puzzle Game
An Open Source HTML5 Crossword Puzzle Game based on Crossword.js.
Change the words in the **clues.js** file.

This is a mobile-first application, so users must use the virtual keyboard to fill the crossword. Use the hamburger menu to change the number of words included in the puzzle.

For a non-mobile-friendly crossword puzzle game, this project looks interesting: https://github.com/gstasiewicz/crossword
