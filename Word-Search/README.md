# HTML Word Search Game

This is a word search game based on code by Noor: https://github.com/nooraftab/wordsearch (many thanks!)

Click on a letter and drag to fill out the word. The puzzle automatically detects valid directions, which are only horizontal, vertical, and diagonally left-to-right in this version.

Edit the wordsearchcontroller.js file to change the words to find (it is an array of 5x4 words). You need 5 rows for this code to work.

Edit the wordpaths.js file to change the valid directions.
